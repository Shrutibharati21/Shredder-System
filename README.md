# Shredder-System
This project basically protects the chopping of hands of workers from shredder machine using Opencv and Computer vision.
# Introduction:
Hand protection from shredder machines is an important safety concern in industrial and office settings.The problem is when people work with this Shredder
Machine. Sometimes accidentally due to inattention, they lose their hands in this
shredder machine. Here this accident can be solved by using this project. Accidents involving shredders can cause serious injuries, and therefore, it is necessary
to implement measures that can prevent such incidents. One such measure is to
use a computer vision project to detect when a hand is near the shredder machine
and trigger a warning or shut off the machine to prevent injury.
The computer vision project works by analyzing images or video footage from
a camera placed near the shredder machine. It can identify when a human hand
is in close proximity to the shredder and activate a warning signal. The warning
signal can be in the form of a sound, an alarm, or even a visual display. If the
person does not respond to the warning, the computer vision system can shut off
the shredder machine to prevent injury.
# Problem Statement:
Accidents involving shredder machines can cause serious injuries to individuals in
industrial and office settings. While safety measures such as safety guards and
user manuals are implemented, there is still a need for additional safety measures
to prevent accidents.
The problem is that current safety measures may not be sufficient to prevent
accidents, as users may not follow safety guidelines or safety guards may malfunction. As a result, there is a need to develop a system that can detect when a
human hand is in close proximity to the shredder machine and trigger a warning
or shut off the machine to prevent injury.
The proposed solution is to use computer vision technology to detect when a
hand is near the shredder machine and activate a warning or shut off the machine
automatically. The computer vision project will analyze images or video footage
from a camera placed near the shredder machine to identify when a human hand
is in close proximity. The system will then trigger a warning signal or shut off the
machine to prevent injury.
The main objective of the project is to develop a system that can promote
safety, reduce the risk of workplace injuries, and prevent accidents caused by shredder machines. By using computer vision technology to detect when a hand is in
close proximity to the shredder machine and activating a warning or shut off the
machine automatically, this project aims to provide an additional layer of safety
to prevent accidents and promote a safe working environment.
# Project Objective:
This projectâ€™s primary objective is to develop a system that can help prevent
accidents caused by shredder machines, reduce the risk of workplace injuries, and
promote safety. The computer vision project can be customized to meet specific
safety requirements, such as adjusting the sensitivity of the detection system,
setting the warning distance, and configuring the response to the warning signal.
In summary, this project aims to use computer vision technology to improve
safety and protect individuals from injuries caused by shredder machines. By
detecting when a hand is in close proximity to the shredder machine and issuing a
warning signal or shutting off the machine, this project can help prevent accidents
and promote a safe working environment.
